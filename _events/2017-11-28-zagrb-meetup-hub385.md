For the first time we'll have our meetup at the HUB385 co-working space! We have two interesting lectures prepared so make sure you don't miss out!
  
Stanko Krtalic Rusendic: Helix - Ruby extensions done right
  
Helix is a Rust library for writing Ruby extension. With it you can write hassle free extensions with confidence that they won't fail.
  
This talk will introduce you to Ruby extensions, Rust and Helix.
  
Bruno Sutic: Architecture of a distributed service
  
Have you ever extracted a distributed service? I had the pleasure to do that for the past few months and I'd like to share the lessons learned. We'll take a look at the business needs, high-level architecture. On a design level, the interesting aspects are: data and data sharing between services as well as service communication.
  
I'll talk from real, production experience, so no fluff - promise :) I'll share all my knowledge and I hope you'll learn a lot.
