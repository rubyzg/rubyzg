Hi all,
  
our May meetup sponsor is "Q" (https://q-software.com). The meetup and the drinks afterwards will be at their new offices near Park dr. Franje Tuđmana.
  
There will be food, drinks and socializing after the meetup so plan to stay after. Oh, and btw. "Q" is hiring Ruby developers: https://q-software.com/openpositions/ruby-developer/
