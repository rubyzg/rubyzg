Hello everyone,
  
As usual, we're closing the year with our annual December drinkup!
  
We'll be gathering at Fakin Craft Bar on Vukovarska (across from FER, on the back side of Boogaloo). Look for the RubyZg logo on the table so you can easily find us.
  
If you're new, feel free to stop by for good conversations and some relaxed networking. And to all our long-time members - we hope to see you there!
  
**One last thing**: if you have a Ruby Passport make sure you bring it and if you don't - we have a surprise for you ;)
