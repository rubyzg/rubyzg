Hello Ruby-ists!
  
this month we'll be meeting again in our HQ MaMa.
  
The meetup will be held @ MaMa and afterwards we'll meet for drinks in "Cafe u Dvoristu".
  
We are going to have one talk on the repertoire:
  
--------------
  
**Zoran Majstorovic: Ruby Microservices with RabbitMQ**
  
Reliable communication is essential for microservice based architectures. One of the most effective patterns for microservices communication is message queue. We are going to see how a Rubyist can build a scalable architecture using RabbitMQ and run it on the AWS infrastructure in Docker containers.
