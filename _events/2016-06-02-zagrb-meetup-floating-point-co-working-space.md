This year there is a holiday on the last Thursday of the month in May, so the May meetup will actually be held at the beginning of June.
  
Unlike most of the meetups so far, this meetup will be held at the Floating Poing co-working space in Preradoviceva 40, a bit southern in the same street as M.A.M.A.
  
For this meetup we have two talks and are accepting lightning talks:
  
Zoran Majstorovic - Comparison of Ruby HTTP Client Libraries
  
A quick overview of the most popular HTTP Clients - which one to use in your next Ruby program?
  
Berislav Babic - Postavljanje development environmenta za razvoj hibridnih aplikacijia
  
Vecina aplikacija danas nisu Rails (ili php, whatever) monoliti, nego se sastoje od vise razlicitih komponenti koristeci vise razlicitih tehnologija.
  
Razvoj tih komponenti individualno je poprilicno jednostavan, ali ja cu vam ispricati pricu kako sve to uklopiti u jednu cjelinu i biti u mogucnosti razvijati (I acceptance testirati cijelu aplikaciju) kao da radite na produkcijskom environmentu.
  
Toptal (https://www.toptal.com/), the Freelance Engineer Marketplace is buying beers after the meetup. They are also searching for developers so don't be shy and feel free to talk to them during the drink up session.
