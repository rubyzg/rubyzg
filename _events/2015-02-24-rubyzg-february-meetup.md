February meetup is going to take place on 24.2. at the usual location - MaMa Zagreb. We're having some interesting talks accompanied by some lightning talks for the first time.
  
Our talks for this meetup are:
  
* Damir Svrtan - Has anyone seen puts? A talk about method lookup, the ancestor chain and eigenclasses
  
* Radan Skorić - Zašto vaša aplikacija treba proljetno čišćenje i par smjernica kako ga napraviti bez da se upucate u nogu
  
After the meetup we're traditionally going to hang out at Pivnica Medvedgrad, in Ilica.
  
See you there!
