Hi All,
  
This month we're meeting at [Treblle](https://treblle.com/). We'll see a full talk and 2 lightning talks and hear more about Treblle and how they make API development easier. Stick around afterwards for drinks, pizza and conversations. :)
  
\-\-\-\-\-  
Main talk (\~20min):
  
**Treblle Ruby gem**  
by Borna Kapusta  
Introducing Treblle to the Ruby community as a new gem, making it easy to add API monitoring and observability to your Rails applications. We’ll explore common use cases, how it works, and how it integrates with your Rails application.
  
Lightning talks (5-10min):
  
**How to implement app access policies, the right way**  
by Dino Reić  
Personal experience with what to do and what not to do, to have clean and manageable policies, regardless of the project size or app domain.
  
**Rails Importmap**  
by Bruno Sutic  
A new default solution for JavaScript in Rails 8 is "importmap-rails" gem. It's promise is to radically simplify application JS stack, and get rid of Node and any NPM package altogether.  
But, does it hold up to its promise? Is this gem worth looking into? This lightning talk will tell you all about it.
