Hi Everyone,
  
Our next meetup will be at Infinum Office (13th floor, Strojarska 22) and we'll have a presentation followed by a panel discussion.
  
If you want to ensure your Rails app stays up-to-date, managing dependency upgrades is essential. But often, it lands on the backlog until a critical need arises.
  
Join us on January 29th at Infinum’s Zagreb office, where [Marko Ćilimković](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markocilimkovic/), will share how Infinum got all of their Ruby on Rails projects updated with minimal time loss. After his talk, Marko will participate in a panel discussion on the same topic with [Zoran Pleško](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoranplesko/) ([Machinery Agency - Software Development](https://www.linkedin.com/company/machinery-software-development/)), [Rino Kovačević](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rino-kova%C4%8Devi%C4%87-0011a1164/) ([Devōt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devot/)), [Hrvoje Jesenović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrvoje-jesenovic-b53a52b9/) ([Tight Line](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tight-line/)), and moderated by me, Radan.
  
Afterwards, stay for the drinks, pizza and chats!
