**Simple Search in Rails with pg_search**  
by [Dominik Ostroski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-ostroski-225336176/)
  
This talk introduces the pg_search gem and how it enables efficient full-text search in Rails applications. We’ll cover its key features, common use cases, and walk through practical examples, including how we apply it in production projects. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of how to implement simple yet powerful search in their own Rails apps.
  
**RailsWorld from Speaker perspective**  
by [Radan Skorić](https://radanskoric.com/)
  
Radan will be [presenting at RailsWorld](https://rubyonrails.org/world/2025/day-2/radan-skoric). Since this announcement is being published before it's not yet clear what the content of the presentation will be. But Radan will take lots of pictures and notes and share how the conference looked from his perspective.
