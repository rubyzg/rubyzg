Dear Rubyists,
  
The time has come for a yet another meetup!
  
The next one will introduce a few novelties:
  
1. for the first time ever, the meetup will be hosted by a non-Croatian company - [ButterflyMX](https://butterflymx.com/). Several of our community members have been with the company for a long time, and one of them will expand on a peculiar part of their technical journey.  
2. we're introducing a new meetup format. To make it more dynamic the format will consist of **the main talk** and **2 lightning talks**.  
3. meetup will be hosted in the [HUB385 South Academy](https://hub385.com/en/event-space). In the past we hosted a meetup in the lobby. However, this time around we'll have a space all to ourselves!  
4. **the main talk will be recorded** and published on our YT channel. It will serve as an experiment. We had some great talks in the past but unfortunately they withered with time. Moving forward, we aim to collect our speakers efforts in a single, easily accessible, "repository".
  
We'll kick off with light talks and keep the main talk for the second part of the meetup. Two hour block will ensure we have plenty of time for the QA session after each part.
  
After the talks, as usual, the host company will buy us some pizzas and beers, and we'll chill in the lobby talking Ruby.
  
We look forward to seeing you all!

*Lightning talks*
  
1. **Decomposing Rails Normalizers With Proc Composition**  
by *Radan Skorić*  
A very short live coding talk that shows you how you can cleanup and reuse your ActiveRecord normalizers by using only what latest vanilla Ruby and Rails give you. Bonus: the briefest possibe introduction to building Rails DSLs. Ruby makes it so simple it actually fits in a lightning talk.  
2. **Rails PDE - Neovim series 1/3**  
by *Josip Frkin*  
Stack Overflow 2023 survey asserts that Neovim is the most desireable IDE in the industry. It scored even higher than VS Code (81% Neovim > 77% VS Code)! In this three part mini-series I will explain its appeal, how to tailor it to suit your developer needs, and hopefully spark your interest. ^^
  
*Main talk*  
**Deleting 63k LoC with a single decision**  
by *Dario Daić*  
We deleted 75% of the codebase and lived to see another day. In fact, it was a tipping point. We cut developer costs, boosted DX, and created a new revenue stream. It sounds glamorous, but it wasn't. It was rough. A single pattern saved us.  
The question is, how we got there in the first place!?
