Hello, Rubyists!
  
First meetup in the year 2017 is upon us!
  
Presentations will be held in our usual meeting place at MaMa, and will be followed with lots of beer and chit-chat at the usual location Pivnica Medvedgrad (Ilica).
  
Bruno and Tomislav put some work in and have prepared the following content for us...
  
Bruno Sutić - gRPC (micro)services at LockState | Full talk
  
In this presentation I'll talk about gRPC: a high-performance RPC framework that powers Google's infrastructure (Ruby perspective). I'll then show and demo how we at LockState utilize that framework to organize our services infrastructure.
  
Tomislav Mikulin - Ansible for Rubyists | Full talk
  
You just finished your Rails app and have to get it online. What do you do?  
If you're looking for a configuration management tool that will help you provision your server(s), and/or deploy your Rails app then Ansible might be just for you. In this talk you will see just how easy it is to get started with Ansible.
  
See you there!
