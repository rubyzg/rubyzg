Hello Rubyists!
  
We're opening our regular meetup season with an event @ Five digital agency who are our sponsors for this month.
  
Be sure not to miss the meetup location address which is "Heinzelova 33".
  
For this meetup we have two talks and one lightning talk. Please get in touch if you'd want to present a lightning talk.
  
Stjepan Hadjić - Mina 1.0, the rewrite
  
We set out on a journey to rewrite a pretty solid and production ready deploy tool. In this talk I'll explain how and why we decided to do that.
  
Tomislav Mikulin - Active Record Associations
  
There are a lot of nifty things that Rails lets you do with associations. In this speech I'll talk about some of them.
  
Bruno Sutić - DB foreign keys in Rails (lightning talk)
  
Rails gets better and better (and bigger :) with every release. If you learned Rails a long time ago, you might find new-ish "foreign keys" feature interesting. It was released in version 4.2 and should become a standard in your development toolkit.
  
Five (http://five.agency), the digital agency are our host and sponsor of the meetup so they'll be providing us with ample beer, snacks, donuts and refreshments. Five is also searching for developers (http://five.agency/careers/ruby-rails-developer-mz/). So, don't be shy and feel free to talk to them during the drink up session.
