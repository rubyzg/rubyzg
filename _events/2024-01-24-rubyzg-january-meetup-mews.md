Hi All,
  
We're kicking of the year of 2024 with a meetup hosted at [Mews](https://developers.mews.com/). If you remember, we had a great meetup there in February of last year.
  
We have two very interesting presentations lined up. After the meetup stick around, catch up and enjoy some drinks and pizza, courtesy of [Mews](https://developers.mews.com/).
