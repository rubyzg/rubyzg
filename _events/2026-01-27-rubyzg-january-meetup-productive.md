Hello everyone,
  
I'm happy to announce our next meetup will be hosted by [Productive](https://productive.io) (Strojarska 20, 5th floor).
  
We'll have an interesting talk followed by a panel discussion, both centered around the challenges of "data imports". The panel brings together experts from a wide range of company sizes and language backgrounds, so we can explore the topic from hands-on implementation to broader business impact.
  
Stick around afterwards for some food, drinks, and conversations. Hope to see you at Productive!

**Data Imports**  
by Borna Artić  
At Productive, we import a lot of data, and doing it reliably has turned out to be trickier than it looks. In this talk I'll start with the "why": what imports solve for us, what kinds of data we bring in, and what we learned from earlier approaches.
  
Then we'll walk through the current importer and the tradeoffs behind it: validating messy input, keeping complexity under control, and making it fast enough to run at scale. We'll also touch on edge cases like custom fields, missing relationships, and handling repeated data updates.
  
**Panel: Data Imports Across Industries**  
Panelists:  
\- Josip Stuhli\, CTO at SofaScore \(PHP\)  
\- Dario Daić\, Product Architect at ButterflyMX \(Ruby\)  
\- Borna Artić\, Backend Engineer at Productive \(Ruby\)  
Moderator: Bruno Sutić  
After the talk, we'll keep the momentum with a panel discussion on data imports. We'll start from the hands-on problems you see in Ruby code, then zoom out to questions of architecture and long-term maintainability, and finally to the company-level impact: how data flows affect other teams, product decisions, and what the business can (and can't) do with the information it has.
  
Expect a practical conversation with real tradeoffs rather than perfect answers. The panel brings together interesting people across seniority levels, company sizes, and language backgrounds.
