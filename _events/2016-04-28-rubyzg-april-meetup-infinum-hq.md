Unlike meetups so far, the April meetup will be held at the Infinum Headquarters in Zagreb.
  
We'll have 3 talks and a slot for lightning talks afterwards:
  
Stanko Krtalic-Rusendic: Stubs, mocks and spies  
What are stubs, mocks, spies and fakes?  
How can they improve my tests?  
Those are two questions that I want to answer with this talk.  
Stubs, mocks and spies are essential tools of every testing library. After this talk you'll test code like you never thought was possible.
  
Radan Skoric: Build a DSL for fun and profit
  
Radan will show us how to build a small DSL (Domain Specific Language) during a live coding session.
  
Dario Daic - Learn more about PRY than just sticking 'binding.pry' in your code.
  
Beers afterwards will be in a bar called Culto, just behind the building in the VMD complex.
