We have two interesting presentations on our June meetup:
  
Bruno Sutic - Readline + Irb/Pry
  
As ruby developers we often work in command line environment via irb or pry consoles. In this talk I’ll show how irb/pry use readline package quietly in the background. I’ll show some of the benefits readline gives us as well as one trick that is useful just for ruby.
  
Stjepan Hadjic - From MySQL to Postgres, a journey of a thousand tests.
  
Tips, tricks and pitfalls you need to watch out when migrating your project from mysql to postgres.
  
This will be our latest meetup before the summer break. During the summer we will organize drinkups and wait until September to start with our meetup agendas again.
  
After this meetup we will go to Pivnica Medvedgrad as usual :)
