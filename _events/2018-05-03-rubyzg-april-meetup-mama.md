Hello Ruby-ists,
  
it's time for our regular monthly meetup (slightly delayed this time :).
  
The meetup will be held @ MaMa and afterwards we'll meet for drinks in "Cafe u Dvoristu".
  
As always, some of the members of our community have prepared awesome talks for us:
  
--------------
  
**Stanko Krtalić-Rusendić: HTTP2.rb**
  
Why arent' all Rack apps served over HTTP 2 by now? What exactly is HTTP 2 and is it better than HTTP 1.1? How can you use it in Ruby?
  
**Bruno Sutic: Ruby and Unix**
  
In case you don't know Ruby is very much inspired and close to Unix philosophy. In this talk I'm going to explain and demonstrate a interesting bits and pieces of working on Unix with Ruby. You're going to see why daemons are good and zombies are bad!
