Hi all,  
February meetup is sponsored by [Mews](https://www.mews.com/en/products/pos), who acquired Bizzon last year.
  
This time Mirko from Mews and Rino from Devot will share some of their practices and insights from their most recent projects.
  
After the meetup we'll hang around Mews/Bizzon's cozy office, so stay around, have a chat with fellow Rubyists, and enjoy pizza üçïand some drinks üçπ.
  
Lastly, take note that [Mews has a number of open roles](https://www.mews.com/en/careers/jobs), so check them out!

**Intro to RSpec and best practices**

In addition to the introduction to RSpec, listen and note the best practices for *unit* and *integration* testing.

**Background jobs in Rails**  
by Rino Kovaƒçeviƒá  
Duration: 25 minutes + questions
  
In web applications, there is often a need for some background tasks: mailings, billing processing, tasks that require third-party services or APIs, etc. Background jobs are pieces of backend code that run asynchronously as background processes to ensure that the front end can handle incoming web requests promptly so users have a better User Experience using our web apps.  
This talk will focus on implementing those jobs with Ruby on Rails, basic knowledge of the language should be enough to follow.
