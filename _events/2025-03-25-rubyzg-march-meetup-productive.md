Hello everyone,
  
I'm happy to announce our next meetup will be hosted by [Productive](https://productive.io) (Strojarska 20, 5th floor). We'll have an interesting talk and a panel discussion. Stick around afterwards for some food, drinks, and conversations :)
  
Hope to see you at Productive!

**Giving users the ability to query their data via raw SQL**  
by Stjepan Hadjić  
Our users' need for advanced data exploration outgrew Productive reporting capabilities. To address this, we built a tool to give them the freedom of using raw SQL queries. This talk will explore the pros and cons of this approach, and whether it might be the right solution for your app.
  
**Panel: Platform engineering for Rails apps**  
Panelists: Hrvoje Matić, Tomislav Capan, Zoran Meliš  
Moderator: Bruno Sutić  
You have an awesome Rails app, and you're ready to put your it in front of the users. But, where should you deploy it: AWS, GCP, Heroku or something else? Is the "bare metal" trend taking off, and should you look into that? What tools should you use for deployment, and when do you introduce CI/CD?  
Keeping a Rails app running takes a lot of decisions that have nothing to do with Rails itself. In this panel, we'll talk about DevOps and Platform engineering best practices for Rails apps.
