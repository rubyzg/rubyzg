Join us at the end of March for some interesting talks at m.a.m.a. and beers afterwards at Pivnica Medvedgrad:
  
Janko Marohnić - Improve file uploads with Shrine
  
Accepting file uploads is very common in web applications, but also very delicate; we have to manage the fact that it's slow, and that it comes with a lot of security implications.
  
Few months ago I released Shrine, a new Ruby library for file uploads, which aims to address limitations and issues of existing libraries (CarrierWave, Paperclip, Dragonfly and Refile).
  
We will see how Shrine's design differs, and how it makes Shrine simple where other libraries are complex, while also making some very advanced features possible.
  
Ante Barać - Ruby on Rails na skliskom terenu
  
Ruby on Rails na skliskom terenu. Veliki site, veliki promet, puno birokracije, dislocirani timovi, spor API i gomila naslijeđenog koda upitne kvalitete. Sto smo naucili?
  
Lightning talks:
  
Have an interesting idea for a short talk? Let us know!
