Hi Rubyists,  
the summer has arrived, so it's time for another relaxed gathering with Ruby fellows! This time, we'll be meeting at our standard drinkup place, Pivnica Medvedgrad in Ilica, to enjoy some good drinks and even better conversations.
  
There will be no official talks or presentations, but you are more than welcome to take your laptop and show us your new Ruby learning or discovery.
  
The table will be marked with RubyZG logo so you can easily find us. We're looking forward to seeing familiar faces and welcoming new ones.
  
See you in Pivnica Medvedgrad!  
Bruno
