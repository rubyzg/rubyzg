Hi everyone!  
After a long break we are ready to kickoff our in-person meetups @ Mama!
  
We will have two talks this time:
  
\-\-\-
  
Bruno Sutic - Async Ruby  
With version 3.0 asynchronous programming in Ruby became a reality! We have the awesome `async` gem and its ecosystem, but there are also native approaches allowing you to gain the benefits of asynchronous paradigm using just the built-in Ruby methods - no frameworks required.
  
From Rails to core Ruby, there's a lot of async innovation going on. This talk aims to give you the overview of this ecosystem in Ruby and answer these questions:
  
* What are the benefits of asynchronous Ruby?  
* Does it work with Rails?  
* Should you use `async` gem or just built-in Ruby methods?  
* How do you use it? How to get started?
  
Async is where a lot of the advancement of the Ruby language is happening. Join me in this talk and find all about it!

Stanko Krtalic R. - Hotwired  
This talk will be an introduction to Hotwired, a bundle of three frameworks that enable server-side rendered pages to act and feel as single page applications.  
The frameworks are:  
\* Turbo - a successor to TurboLinks but with expanded functionality through the addition of turbo frames and turbo streams  
\* Stimulus - a component framework that turns pre-rendered HTML into JS components  
\* Strada - his part of the talk is reverse engineered out of Hey's source code; Strada is a framework/communication protocol that enables the frontend JS to interact with native host functionality
