Join us for the last Ruby meetup this season and the official summer break!
  
We will meet at MaMa, our usual meetup place. Afterwards, we'll hang out and drink a beer or two at Pivnica Medvedgrad (Ilica) as we always do.
  
Get in touch if you have an idea for a lightning ⚡️ speech!

Bruno Sutic: Architecture for scaling IoT devices
  
Internet connected devices pose some interesting challenges. In this talk I'll present the problems my company had with an existing infrastructure and I'll discuss our new approach - both high and low level. I'll share lessons learned and practical problems we had to solve.
  
- Ruby native C extensions vs FFI: which one to choose and why?  
- Writing a standalone Ruby process is that easy?  
- Threads; do they hurt? :)

As usual at the end we'll have GitHub and JetBrains prizes giveaway!
