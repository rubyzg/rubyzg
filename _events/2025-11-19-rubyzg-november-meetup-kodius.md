Hello Rubyists of Zagreb!  
I'm happy to announce our November meetup with two interesting speakers covering very different topics.
  
This month we're at [Kodius](https://kodius.com/) agency. They've hosted the meetup a few times now and we're happy to be back. Thank you for supporting the meetup! Stay after the talks for drinks, pizza and conversations.
  
Here's what we'll learn about:
  
**Roda routing with functional patterns in Ruby**  
by [Marko Matotan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-matotan-4b2216216/)  
We'll explore Roda routing, compare it to Rails, and see how combining it with functional programming patterns can clean up code and make it more maintainable.
  
**Swift for Rubyists - Bridging the Gap**  
by [Zoran Majstorović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoranmajstorovic/)  
We will explore the basic concepts of the Swift programming language from a Ruby developer's perspective.
