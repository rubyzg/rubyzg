Hello everybody!
  
We're kicking off our new season of meetups at our usual spot @ MaMa, and afterwards we'll head for a drink to Dvoriste.
  
This year we'll be having a meetup every other month. That means that our next meetup will be held in December.

Talks:
  
**1. Dario Daic: Factory method pattern**
  
You've most likely encountered one in your career. It might have been written well, it might have not. Inspecting roots of the pattern will help us shed light on what it actually is, when to use it, and how to implement it in Ruby.
  
**2. Martin Morava: Implementing your own OAuth provider**
  
Ever wondered how ‘Sign in with Google’ works in the background? How cool would be to support the same functionality in your own app and give user option to ‘Sign in with MyCoolApp’ . This talk with teach you via actual code examples how to implement OAuth provider in your app.
