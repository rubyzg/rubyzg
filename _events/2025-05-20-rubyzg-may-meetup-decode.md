Hi everyone!
  
Join us for the RubyZG May meetup where we have two interesting talks about deploying Ruby and Rails apps.
  
This event is hosted by [DECODE](https://decode.agency/about-us/) who will be providing snacks and refreshments after the formal part of the meetup. Btw. they are hiring, so be sure to check [their open positions](https://decode.agency/careers/).
  
For those coming by car, there will be parking available in the garage located in the same building.
  
See you at DECODE!

**Deploying Rails apps to AWS using Terraform**  
by Roko Labrović  
Presentation will cover creating a multi-environment infrastructure for a Ruby on Rails API application on AWS using Terraform. It will focus on configuring the AWS CLI and Terraform, writing Terraform scripts to manage AWS resources, structuring Git branches, and setting up Bitbucket Pipelines to automate code checks, testing, Docker builds, and ECS deployments.
  
**Docker as Version Control for Ruby devs**  
by Josip Igrec  
You've heard that using docker simplifies deployments, makes things more  
secure, and other similar arguments. While they're all mostly true, people often overlook that having a list of images makes it way easier to revert changes and track regressions in your app.  
In this talk we'll cover the basics of Docker and how you can use it to make sure that your deployed systems don't break (as often).
