Hi everyone!
  
Join us for the RubyZG February. We'll hear about building a query builder with AI and what is like to work at a company where Ruby On Rails itself was created.
  
This event is hosted by [DECODE](https://decode.agency/about-us/) who will be providing snacks and refreshments after the formal part of the meetup. Btw. they are hiring, so be sure to check [their open positions](https://decode.agency/open-positions/).
  
For those coming by car, there will be parking available in the garage located in the same building.
  
See you at DECODE!

How to use AI agents to build query builder  
by [Lovro Žmak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lovro-zmak-22706253/)  
Does code generation with AI agents always help or is it better to manually write it sometimes ?  
How does Arel fit into the story and how did it influence the code design decisions ?  
This talk will bring you the story of building a query builder with AI agents, from initial  
wrong directions to the final solution. Through practical examples and live demos,  
you will receive guidelines on how to use AI agents to generate usable and sustainable code.
  
**Working at 37signals: The birthplace of Ruby On Rails**  
by [Stanko Krtalić Rusendić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanko-krtalic/)  
Last July Stanko started working at [37signals](https://37signals.com/), the company behind Basecamp, Hey & Fizzy and the place from which the very first version or Ruby On Rails was extracted back in 2004. It's still the company with the largest influence on the direction of Rails development with major contributions like ActiveStorage, SolidQueue, Turbo & Stimulus. We'll hear how the company works and what it's like to work there.
