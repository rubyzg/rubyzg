Hello Rubyists,
  
this time we will talk about everything Ruby in a brand new and shiny Ars Futura office! :)
  
Let me rewind that a bit... Ars Futura is a digital agency which was founded five years ago by two of its founders Ivan Bozic and Nikola Jakic. They have a very healthy client base with plenty of interesting projects. For all you gamers, I supposedly heard they've been also developing some apps for the Activision Blizzard. ^^  
I will spoil no more and give you all a chance to shoot questions their way on site!
  
For more info take a look at their website in order to get a better overview of who is going to welcome us come October 30th - https://arsfutura.co .

Main talk  
~~~~~~~~~
  
Docker on Rails  
Ivan Oštrić, Back-end Developer @ Ars Futura
  
Hello, developers. Look at your server, now back to mine, now back at your server, now back to mine. Sadly, your server is not running containerised applications and easily reproducible builds. But if you stopped installing everything on the host and switched to Docker, it could smell like it is mine. Look down. Back up. Where are you? You’re on a boat, not worrying about permissions and finding the right version of the library while trying to make the production environment reflect the development one as best as you can. What’s in your hand? Back at my server. It’s a mouse pointing to a button that lets you deploy your app with a single click. Look again. The button is now diamonds. Anything is possible when your server runs Docker. I’m on a horse.
  
Intro talk
