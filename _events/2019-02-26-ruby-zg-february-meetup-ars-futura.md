Hi all,
  
February meetup is sponsored by Ars Futura!
  
This time Nikola and Ivan from Ars Futura will share some of their practices and insights from their most recent projects.
  
After the meetup we'll hang around in their neat office, so stay around and have a chat will fellow Rubyists like you usually do. ^^
  
Intro talk  
------------  
DIY – Create Your Own Rails Generator  
- Ivan Matas, Back-end Developer @ Ars Futura
  
Generators are an essential tool to improve your workflow.  
Service objects are great for creating and maintaining DRY and reusable code.  
In a few simple steps, I’ll walk you through the process of creating your very own service generator.
  
Main talk  
------------  
Design patterns in Ruby on Rails  
- Nikola Jakić, co-founder @ Ars Futura
  
Design patterns are an intelligent approach to resolving problems that developers commonly encounter.  
Most people know about them, some people use them, and some aren't even aware that they are.  
How do we recognize which problems they can solve? What are their benefits? How do we use them?  
In this talk, we will try to answer this questions and identify most popular ones that can be used in your current and future RoR projects.
