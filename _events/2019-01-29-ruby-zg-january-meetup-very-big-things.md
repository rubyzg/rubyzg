Hi!  
This month our meetup is sponsored by Very Big Things. They are looking for developers so hit them up after the Meetup.
  
Our speaker will be Stanko with this talk "MRuby crash course".
  
The talk introduces MRuby and explains the motivation behind the project by contrasting it with the traditional approach in embedded devices and it's applicability to real-world projects.
  
If you are interested to give a lightning talk or to give a full talk, please send us a message.
