Hello everybody!
  
Let's have our November meetup at our usual spot @ MaMa and then go for a beer or coffee/tea to Dvoriste.
  
Update: the sponsor of the meetup is http://www.masinerija.com. They will buy us drinks, and hey, they are looking for a RoR developer: http://www.masinerija.com/blog/misc/masinerija-is-hiring

Talks:
  
**Hrvoje Simic: My short experience with Stimulus**
  
Stimulus describes itself as "A modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have". But what is it really about? In this talk, I would like to share my experience of working with Stimulus, a JavaScript framework invented by the folks of Basecamp. This topic will be interesting to full stack developers.
  
**Bruno Sutic: Integrating Vera IOT devices**
  
I spent the last 6 months working on an integration with Vera controllers: a smart-home hub for all your IOT ("Internet of things") devices. The project is in production for one month now. In this talk I want to go through "the good, bad and the ugly" of integrating with yet another IOT device/platform.
