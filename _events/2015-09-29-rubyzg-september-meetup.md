Join us for our first meetup after the summer break!
  
We'll have two interesting talks and afterwards go for some drinks @ Pivnica Medvedgrad!
  
Stanko Krtalic Rusendic - RethinkDB
  
RethinkDB is a no-SQL database aiming to combine the best to MongoDB and Redis.In my opinion it is the Postgres of no-SQL databases, and a quick introduction is in order!
  
Jan Varljen - Active Record Views
  
Jan will talk about the ins and outs of using SQL views with Active Record.
  
Intercom is sponsoring five tickets for Webcamp, which we'll raffle in the end.
