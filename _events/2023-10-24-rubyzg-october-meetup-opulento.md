Hi all,  
After a half year break, we're ready to get into a more regular meetup cadence. To kick it off, this October meetup is sponsored by [Opulento](https://www.opulento.hr/), a very interesting accounting firm that has a lot of experience helping software companies.
  
We've also got an international speaker lineup this time. Read on for more details. ;)
  
After the meetup we'll hang around Opulento's office, so stay around, have a chat with fellow Rubyists, catch up what everyone is doing, and enjoy pizza üçïand some drinks üçπ.

**What's new in Rails?**  
by Miha Rekar  
Duration: 20 minutes + questions
  
Rails 7.1 has recently been released. Have you caught up with all the important new stuff? Worry not, because hailing from the far away and exotic Slovenia we have Miha Rekar who will not only make our meetup international but give us a summary of all the important new stuff in Rails 7.1. To sugar it up he will also get us up to speed on Kamal (the library formerly known as MRSK).
  
**Typed Ruby**  
by Radan Skoriƒá  
Duration: 20 minutes + questions
  
With more and more investment in gradual typing systems for Ruby and an endorsement from the core team, you might be wondering, should I add typing to my project? Am I a bad developer if I don't? We'll have a look at basics of two Ruby typing systems: Sorbet and RBS, and help you get to grips with how you should feel about it.
