Hi All,
  
This month we're meeting at [Kodius agency](https://kodius.com/) and both of the talks are from their developers. They've attended several recent meetups and were quite eager to host a meetup themselves. As usual, after the meetup stick around, catch up and enjoy some drinks and pizza. :)

**Ruby constant lookup**  
by Mateo Vukušić  
Understanding how Ruby handles constant lookup is important for every Ruby programmer, yet this process is often taken for granted. In this presentation, we will discuss the basics of Ruby constants, explore how Ruby performs a constant lookup, and the mechanisms of automatic constant loading in Rails.
  
**State of developer experience tools and LSPs in Ruby**  
by Marko Matotan  
While Ruby has a human-friendly syntax, the developer tools available for linting and 'language intelligence' may not be as ideal. This talk will focus on the current state and comparison of the most common LSPs and development tools in Ruby to maximize developer experience.
  
*Note: Presentations will be in Croatian.*
