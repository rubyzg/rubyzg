Hi All,
  
This month we're back at [Kodius agency](https://kodius.com/) and we're trying a slightly different format.
  
We'll have 3 short presentations, aka lightning talks. All of them will give a short intro to an "alternative" Ruby web framework. Alternative here just means: something that's not Rails:
  
* **Mateo Vukušić** will talk about [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/).  
* **Marko Matotan** will talk about [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net/).  
* **Iskren Nemet** will talk about [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/).
  
After the presentations we'll have a short panel discussion on the topic of: "When does it make sense to go off the Rails?" (pun very much intended)
  
I (Radan) will moderate the discussion. I may or may not include more cringy dad jokes, depending on how I feel on the day. You'll just have to take the risk.
  
At some point I'll decide we're done and then we can continue the discussions and conversations with some food and drinks at the Kodius offices.
  
*Note: Presentations will be in Croatian.*
