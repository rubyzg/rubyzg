Join us for the first official Ruby meetup in the new season!
  
We will meet at MaMa, our HQ. Afterwards, we'll hang out and drink a beer or two at Cafe U Dvoristu, which has become our default go-to spot for caffeine and alcohol.

Janko Marohnić: A look into HTTP.rb (and why you shouldn't use Net::HTTP)
  
With so many HTTP client gems out there it can be difficult to decide which one to use. In this talk I would like to show you why I think that HTTP.rb is definitely a good choice.  
We will start with some advantages in the design like the chainable API and exception handling, go through some nice features like persistent connections and (de)compressing, and finish off with some more advanced stuff like timeouts and streaming.  
After the talk you will hopefully know more about what makes a good HTTP client.
