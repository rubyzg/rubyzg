Hello Rubyists!
  
The second meetup of this season is going to be held in the office of Q-Alliance (http://q-alliance.com/) who are our sponsors for this month.
  
Be sure not to miss the meetup location address which is "Amruseva 6".
  
For this meetup we have two talks and are accepting lightning talks! Please get in touch if you'd want to present a lightning talk.
  
Melita Kokot - Automate API documentation through tests with DOX
  
Writing API documentation is usually a cumbersome job! Documentation easily gets stale and out of date so why not automate it? Melita built DOX (https://github.com/infinum/dox), a gem to automate generating API documentation through your RSpec tests, cutting down the boring job of manually writing it and ensuring it never gets stale!
  
Stanko Krtalic Rusendic - Steganography - a seemingly useless gem. Or is it?
  
Sick and tired of those pesky watermarks ruining photos? Or perhaps you have something to hide, but don’t want people to suspect something? Using Ruby and steganography it’s possible to hide messages in plain sight. Though it seems useless it’s applications are limitless.
