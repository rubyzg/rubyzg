Hi everybody!
  
We're continuing with physical meetups! For November we will have our meetup at the Q Agency who are generously sponsoring this meetup with drinks and allowing us to host the meetup in their office at Reljkovićeva st. 4.
  
We have two talks lined up.
  
The talks will start at 18:15 with a short intro from the sponsor, followed by the first talk, then a 10 min break, the second talk, and an outro word from the sponsor. Afterwards we have the space to mingle and talk until 20:30.

Talks:
  
*Vlado Cingel - Value objects*
  
In this short talk we will see how simple Value Objects can add a lot of "value" to your codebase.
  
Vlado is a regular speaker at the meetup and this talk was inspired by recent experience on a project.
  
*Bruno Sutic - Rails Billing*  
Every developer's TODO list:  
1\. Build a popular \(Rails\) app 💻  
2\. Charge users on a monthly basis 💰  
3\. Live the life of your dreams \(on Bahamas\, Bali\.\.\.🏝 \) 🕶 🙌  
While you probably know how to build a good web app 💻, and how to live a good  
life 🏝 , how would you go about charging users 💸? One popular option is  
Stripe. They are famous for their "developers first" approach and easy to use  
APIs. Since recently Stripe is available in Croatia 🎉!  
This talk will tell you how a developer's dream-life 🏝 journey and  
Stripe integration turned from optimism 👍 into a nightmare 🙈.  
Dear developers, it turns out that integrating with a venerable Stripe is hard.  
Their tutorials are not so good, and their docs are complicated.  
Please join me in this talk to find out how to make subscription payments  
💰 for your app easier.
  
Bruno is a co-organizer and regular speaker at the meetup and this talk was inspired by something he was working on.
