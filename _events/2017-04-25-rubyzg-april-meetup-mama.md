Dear Rubyists,
  
it is time for our April meetup!
  
The meetup will take place at our usual meeting place at MaMa, after which we will hang out and drink some beer at the Pivnica Medvedgrad (Ilica) like we usually do. :)

Vedran Hrnčić - Going off the rails
  
There is an established route when working with Rails, commonly known as “the Rails way”. Those kind of routes are reliable and verified by a wide range of developers, but after some time become boring. Nowadays I’m into exploring, spending a lot of time off the rails, and probing new trails.
  
Nenad Nikolić - Caching in Rails  
I will give a high level overview of caching techniques commonly used in Rails apps. Caching mainly helps to ease scaling pains and speed up response time. Because of its complexity it is an often overlooked technique. The aim of the talk is to unravel the complexity and prompt you to use it on your next project.
