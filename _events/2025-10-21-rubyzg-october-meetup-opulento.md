Hello Rubyists!  
I'm happy to announce our October meetup with two interesting talks.
  
This month our host is [Opulento](https://opulento.hr) \- an accounting firm that specializes in services and IT work\. This is the second time we have an event at their office \- first one was in 2023\, just after Covid lockdown\. Big thanks to Opulento for supporting Ruby community\.
  
Here are our topics for the event:
  
**RailsBilling - new commercial gem**  
by Bruno Sutić  
RailsBilling is a gem for adding modern billing subscriptions to your Rails app. It works out of the box, and installation takes a couple minutes. In this speech you will learn why it's needed and I'll also share some numbers about the launch of the project.
  
**Hotwire++**  
by Fran Zekan  
Explore advanced techniques and patterns for building modern, reactive web applications with Hotwire, going beyond the basics to unlock the full potential of Turbo, Stimulus, and Strada. Learn how to tackle complex UI challenges while maintaining the simplicity and productivity that makes Hotwire a powerful alternative to heavy JavaScript frameworks.
