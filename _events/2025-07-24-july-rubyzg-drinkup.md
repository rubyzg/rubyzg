Hey Ruby folks,
  
Summer's in full swing, and it's the perfect time to cool off with a cold drink and warm conversation! Join us for the July RubyZG drinkup — a casual evening of chatting, geeking out, and enjoying good vibes with fellow Rubyists.
  
📍 Where: Pivnica Medvedgrad, Ilica  
🍻 What: Beers, juices, coffee, food — something for everyone  
💬 Why: Because Ruby is more fun with friends
  
There’s no agenda, no talks, just hanging out. Feel free to bring your laptop if you’ve got something cool to share — a side project, a gem you love, or even a bug that’s driving you nuts. Or just bring yourself!
  
Look for the RubyZG logo on the table so you know where to find us. Whether you're a regular or it's your first time, you're more than welcome.
  
See you there!  
Stanko
