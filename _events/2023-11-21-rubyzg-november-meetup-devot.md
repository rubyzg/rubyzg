Hi Everyone,
  
The November meetup is sponsored by [Devot](https://devot.team/), a software development agency founded by a member of this very meetup group: Martin Morava.
  
After the meetup we'll hang around Devot's office, so stay around, have a chat with fellow Rubyists, catch up, and enjoy pizza üçïand some drinks üçπ.

**Making a web app - the hard way**  
by Bruno Sutiƒá  
Duration: 20 minutes + questions
  
The journey of making my own, commercial web app was unexpectedly hard - and long.In this speech I want to tell you all about it. Why is Stripe integration so hard? Why can't I find a good (and affordable) designer? What about copy? I'll touch on all these problems, tell you what I did, and offer practical solutions.
  
**Dissecting Service Objects**  
by Juraj Sulimanoviƒá  
Duration: 20 minutes + questions
  
The Service Object design pattern is commonly used to encapsulate one action in your domain logic using Plain Old Ruby Objects. This design pattern gained popularity as a response to oversized models. However, we have to be careful as Using Service Objects can lead to using procedural code masquerading as an object, rather than modeling your domain logic. We will explore how this design pattern can become an anti-pattern and see how the service layer should be used.
