Hi Everyone,
  
The June meetup is the back at [Devot](https://devot.team/), for the third time, and second time this year. Big thanks to Devot for supporting the local Ruby community.
  
After the meetup we'll hang around Devot's office, so stay around, have a chat with fellow Rubyists, catch up, and enjoy pizza üçïand some drinks üçπ.
  
**Important note: The location has moved slightly from last time we were at Devot. The office is in the same building block but on the other side, check the address carefully.**
  
We have two interesting presentations scheduled:
  
**Lessons from migrating a legacy frontend to Hotwire**  
by Radan Skoriƒá  
*This is a preview of [a talk that will be on this year's RailsWorld conference](https://rubyonrails.org/world/2025/speakers/radan-skoric).* *The talk will be in English.*
  
Is Hotwire just for \`rails new\` scenario and not worth it for mature applications? Absolutely not. Radan shares his learnings from leading a migration of Halalbooking.com, a large hotel booking website, from a mix of technologies centered on React to Hotwire.
  
**Use the source, Luke**  
by Bruno Sutiƒá *(lightning talk)*  
What do you do when you can't solve a coding problem? What do you do when even AI can't solve it? If the docs don't have an answer, the source code does. It's the truth the elite programmers have always been preaching!
  
In this talk I'll share my insights, tools, and practical tips and tricks for reading the source code of Ruby gems, Rails and even Ruby itself.
