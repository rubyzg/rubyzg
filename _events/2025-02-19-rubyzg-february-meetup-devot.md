Hi Everyone,
  
The February meetup is the second meetup sponsored by [Devot](https://devot.team/), a software development agency founded by a member of this very meetup group: Martin Morava.
  
After the meetup we'll hang around Devot's office, so stay around, have a chat with fellow Rubyists, catch up, and enjoy pizza üçïand some drinks üçπ.
  
We have two interesting presentations scheduled:
  
**Building games with DragonRuby**  
by Filip Defar  
Duration: 15 minutes + questions  
Ruby is a general-purpose programming language but is often taken seriously only in web development.  
DragonRuby opens the door for Ruby developers to build performant 2D games for desktop, mobile, and console platforms. In this talk, I will discuss the project's philosophy and share my experience learning the basics of DragonRuby.
  
**Code as Design**  
by Juraj Sulimanoviƒá  
Duration: 20 minutes + questions  
Why is software so unique among engineering fields and what is the difference between them? What is software design and what makes a design good? By exploring the relationship between software engineering and software design we will come to some interesting introspections and surprising conclusions about the nature and beauty of software.
