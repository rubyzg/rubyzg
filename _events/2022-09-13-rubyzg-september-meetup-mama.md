Hello everybody!
  
After the summer we're continuing with physical meetups! For September we're back at MaMa and we have two interesting talks lined up. This time, both talks will be in English.
  
Afterwards we'll go to "Caffe u Dvoristu" for drinks.
  
***
  
Talks:
  
*Vlado Cingel - Value objects*
  
In this short talk we will see how simple Value Objects can add a lot of "value" to your codebase.
  
Vlado is a regular speaker at the meetup and this talk was inspired by recent experience on a project.
  
*Fabien Loup - Clean APIs with Grape*  
An introduction to Grape DSL for clean API code. And with just a few plugins we'll se how to abstract boilerplate away so we can concentrate on the business logic. The result will be just Grape!
  
Fabien is an out of town guest, visiting Zagreb at the time of the meetup and has accepted an invitation to present.
